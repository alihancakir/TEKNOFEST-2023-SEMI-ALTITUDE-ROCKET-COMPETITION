Hello everyone,

In 2023, I participated in the "TEKNOFEST Mid-Altitude Rocket Competition". 
The competition included tasks such as the first recovery at 9000 ft altitude and the second recovery at 500 meters. 
I developed an algorithm to accomplish these tasks, which enhanced my knowledge and experience in C programming. 
Additionally, I designed a Windows Forms application using C++ to analyze data with the ground station.
Unfortunately, it is not possible to upload all the documents here.
